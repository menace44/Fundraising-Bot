Full Finalization of the FundraisingBot Project
# Fundraising-Bot
üê£ Simple Steps to Build the Fundraising Bot

We‚Äôll break down everything into easy parts, with explanations and code along the way.

Part 1: What We‚Äôre Doing

We are building a Fundraising Bot that lets people donate money to help reach a goal (like $1000). The bot will live on the internet so that anyone can use it from their phone or computer. It will track how much money has been donated and let people see the progress.

Part 2: Files We Need

Here‚Äôs a list of all the important files you will create:

	1.	app.py ‚Äì This file will contain the bot‚Äôs brain and how it runs on the web.
	2.	templates/index.html ‚Äì This is the web page where users will see the progress and donate.
	3.	requirements.txt ‚Äì This file lists what your bot needs to work.
	4.	LICENSE ‚Äì This file sets rules about who can use and share the bot.
	5.	README.md ‚Äì This file explains what the bot does and how to use it.

Part 3: Let‚Äôs Create the Code and Files

1. üß† The Brain ‚Äì app.py

This file runs the bot and allows people to donate. It shows how much has been donated so far and updates the page when new donations are made.

from flask import Flask, request, render_template

app = Flask(__name__)

class AdvancedFundraisingBot:
    def __init__(self, goal_amount):
        """Initialize the fundraising bot with a donation goal."""
        self.goal_amount = goal_amount
        self.donations = {}  # To track user donations
        self.total_donations = 0  # Sum of all donations

    def donate(self, user_name, amount):
        """Accept a donation from a user."""
        if user_name in self.donations:
            self.donations[user_name] += amount
        else:
            self.donations[user_name] = amount
        self.total_donations += amount

    def get_progress(self):
        """Return the progress towards the fundraising goal."""
        return self.total_donations, self.goal_amount

bot = AdvancedFundraisingBot(goal_amount=1000)

@app.route("/")
def index():
    total, goal = bot.get_progress()
    return render_template('index.html', total=total, goal=goal)

@app.route("/donate", methods=["POST"])
def donate():
    user_name = request.form["name"]
    amount = float(request.form["amount"])
    bot.donate(user_name, amount)
    total, goal = bot.get_progress()
    return render_template('index.html', total=total, goal=goal, message=f"Thank you {user_name} for donating ${amount:.2f}!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True)

What does this do?

	‚Ä¢	When someone visits your web page, it shows how much money has been donated so far.
	‚Ä¢	People can type their name and how much they want to donate.
	‚Ä¢	After they click ‚ÄúDonate,‚Äù the page updates to show the new total!

2. üñ•Ô∏è The Web Page ‚Äì templates/index.html

This file shows the web page where users can see the donation progress and fill out a form to donate.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Fundraising Bot</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Fundraising Goal: ${{ goal }}</h1>
    <h2>Total Raised: ${{ total }}</h2>
    
    {% if message %}
        <p>{{ message }}</p>
    {% endif %}

    <form action="/donate" method="POST">
        <label for="name">Name:</label>
        <input type="text" id="name" name="name" required><br><br>
        
        <label for="amount">Donation Amount:</label>
        <input type="number" id="amount" name="amount" required><br><br>
        
        <input type="submit" value="Donate">
    </form>
</body>
</html>

What does this do?

	‚Ä¢	It shows how much has been raised so far and asks people to fill out their name and donation amount.
	‚Ä¢	When they click ‚ÄúDonate,‚Äù the page reloads and shows the new total.

3. üìã The List of Things You Need ‚Äì requirements.txt

This file tells the system what programs are needed to run the bot.

Flask==2.0.1

What does this do?

	‚Ä¢	It tells the computer to install Flask, which makes the web app work.

4. üìÑ The License ‚Äì LICENSE

This file sets the rules for who can use and share the bot.
